I am a MSc student in Computer Software Engineering at the [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en), affiliated with the Data Science Research Group at the [Computer Engineering Department](https://ce.aut.ac.ir/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=8Hhu1Q8AAAAJ). I am working on the intersection of Graph Learning and Information Retrieval. My research interests primarily lie in Recommender Systems, Responsible AI, and Graph Neural Networks.

Prior to that, I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering from the University of Zanjan, where I was advised by [Prof. Mohsen Afsharchi](http://cv.znu.ac.ir/afsharchim/) and worked on Text-based Stock Trend Prediction.
